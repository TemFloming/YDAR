        <p>An enigmatic android, mysterious machine lifeforms, and deadly secrets...<br> 
        <br> Newfound ruins amidst the Duergar Mountains have drawn the attention of curious dwarves and the Warrior of Darkness alike.<br>
        The discovery of a pale-garbed woman calling herself 2P, however, will force these intrepid explorers to confront the reality─and dangers─of technology beyond their wildest imaginings.<br>
        The first step toward understanding the machines' machinations is to delve into the heart of their territory. With 2P at your side, venture forth into the Copied Factory!<br></p>

        <p>Destinies diverge between blades black and white! <br> 
        <br> The white-robed android 2P awakens at last, but so too does an unforeseen danger to Komra. <br> 
        Who is friend, and who is foe? What do those threatening life as dwarves know it truly desire? <br> 
        Answers may well await you and your allies within the Puppets' Bunker, though you will not find them unguarded...<br></p>

        <p>Ascend the tower. The world awaits. <br>
        <br> The white-garbed 2P's discovery was the first domino to fall in a series of conflicts that have only escalated since the arrival of the black-shrouded 2B, <br> 
        the pattern they form growing ever more complex. The time of revelation may be at hand, but is this tale one of hope...or despair?<br></p>
